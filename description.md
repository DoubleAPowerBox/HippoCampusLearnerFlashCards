## Inspiration
We noticed that like us, many students learning digital were not taking the time to study material covered in class on their own, so we set out to figure out a solution. We were then inspired by **Duolinguo** and **Quizlet**. We noticed that quizlet's flashcard format was almost universaly regarded by our peers as a good, fast, effective ways to study materials, however we still felt that it was missing something, which is where Duolinguo comes into play. You see Duolinguo has a daily reminder, a challenge, that without fails reminds you to take your daily lessons, so we thought of implementing a similar feature into our program, but rather than make it daily, we wanted to add an extra layer revolving around **spaced interval learning(SIL)**. For those who do not know, spaced interval learning is the idea that the more you review a concept, the slower you forget about it.![Graph showing the effets of SIL](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bo_Ae_Chun/publication/324816198/figure/fig1/AS:620205050982405@1524879815703/Ebbinghaus-forgetting-curve-and-review-cycle.png) 
## What it does
Our site allows users to create their very own set of flashcards, giving them the ability to categorize which cards they are the most and which cards they are the least confident answering

## How we built it
We built it using mainly HTML, CSS, and Javascript, while touching on topics such as react and bootstrap to assist In our development. We used repl.it for its impresive collaboration features as well as due to its compatibility with git.
## Challenges we ran into
One big challenge we faces was communication, Our team was compased of people who had to go to work, who lived in different time zones, people who went to completely different universities. As you can imagine that meant there was very little time in wich all four memebers could get on at the same time, people making changes without others being aware, but once we got through that we were able to use our different timezones/schedules in order to have at least one person at a time working on the project resulting in almost constant progress.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremly proud of our fully functional cards, as well as having been able to properly format the site intp a mobile friendly display
## What we learned

## What's next for HippoCampus Learner
Defentilty our Spaced interval learning reminder system and a calander to show when your next study session will be
